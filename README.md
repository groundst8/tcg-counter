# Trading Card Game Electronic Counter

## Motivation

I've been wanting to do a project to play around with the Ynvisible electrochromic e-paper displays for a while. I also recently have gotten back into Magic: The Gathering. Given some of the [products](https://www.ynvisible.com/news-inspiration/smart-expiry-date-label) being made with the Ynvisible displays, I was surprised that nothing had been attempted in the trading card game space (at least that I'm aware of). It's seems like a no-brainer but maybe there is a reason it hasn't been done and my goal is to find out.

## Concept

![electronic_counter_concept](https://github.com/groundst8/tcg-counter/assets/53413353/7b87b772-639f-45e6-b7d9-5978f38ef246)

The concept image uses some Wizards of the Coast trademarked images for added coolness factor, but unless some kind of licensing is done or Wizards wants to get involved (let me know haha) that stuff will have to be removed and likely will just be plain text. The sleeve specs will be made available so people can customize and make their own personal designs as well.
